* **Custom App Icons:** Swap out your app's icon with ease, allowing for complete visual rebranding on both platforms.
* **Comprehensive Logging:** Track the changes made by BrandForge with detailed logging, including informative messages, progress indicators, success confirmations, and error reports.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  Operate BrandForge via the command line for efficient automation.
* **Programmatic API:** Integrate BrandForge directly within your Dart code for complete flexibility.

* **Development Environment:** A working development environment configured for Flutter (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code).
* **Command-Line Access:** You are comfortable using the command line or terminal.
* **Image Converter:** To change the app icons, you need an image conversion tool.
